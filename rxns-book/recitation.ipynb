ODEs are functions of a single independent variable and derivatives of the dependent variable.\n\n$F(x,y,y',y',...y^{(n-1)}) = y^n$\n\nSolving simple versions of these equations requires taking the integral of the function.\n\nFor example, how would you solve the following equation: $\\frac{dx}{dt} = cos(t)$?\n\nIf the derivative of $x$ is $cos(t)$, then $x(t) = sin(t) + c$, where $c$ is some arbitrary integration constant.\n\nWe can not solve for $c$ without additional information about. This is where the initial condition comes in. For simplicity, lets say $x(0) = 0$. So the solution should be $x(t) = sin(t)$, where $c$.
